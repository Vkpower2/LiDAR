3D IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION USING LiDAR
Recent advancements in image restoration of 3-dimensional objects have seen significant growth, particularly with the emergence of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology. This project focuses on utilizing a low-cost LiDAR to develop a point cloud and restore the shape of a crushed object. The methodology involves the LiDAR's linear movement and continuous data recording to reconstruct the object's 3D shape. The project employs Cloud Compare software for accurate point cloud visualization.
Through the analysis of 720 files, each containing approximately 5000 points, the project achieves clear visualization of the crushed object, including the edges where the damage occurred. This demonstrates the potential of LiDAR technology in image restoration and the development of point cloud datasets for various objects requiring a 3D view. The findings serve as a foundation for utilizing low-cost LiDARâ€™s in object recovery and contribute to advancements in image restoration technology.

This repository consists of the codes to convert .txt file to .csv files and .las, .laz files and these .las and .laz files to .shp files which will be used as a major group in cloud compare software to recover the 
point cloud based 3D image of the whole scanned object.
The major_project_last.ipynb and major_project_last.py has the codes to convert the Dataset in Dataset file to convert to .shp files.

Below are the outputs obtained by using the created dataset of a crushed tin and also using the TF-Luna LiDAR.
